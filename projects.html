							present a comparative model using Naives Bayes, Max Entropy and SVM classifiers. We also collected
							results using the Random Forest and AdaBoost ensemble classifiers. We achieved an average accuracy

VoiceTravel is an interactive flight search dialogue system designed for
mobile devices running the Android mobile operating system. The app accepts the search criteria
using voice based input from user and returns the flights matching the criteria. The search criteria in
the current version of the application includes origin-city, destination-city, date of travel and an optional
time parameter. The criteria can be specified in
regular English and in any order. Multiple criteria
can be specified in a single utterance as well.

VoiceTravel utilizes advancements in computational linguistics and smartphone space to disrupt
how air travel search is done.

							The motivation of our project is to build a data de-duplication scheme which would enable
							us to build an object repository in a network. A network is characterized by several hosts,
							all requesting concurrent access to files and entering new files (objects) into the network.
							Hence, in order to meet the clients' needs, we need to come up with a computational solution
							which would enable a central server to service these requests and store data with minimum
							storage space.
							We came up with a client-server model where the server would break up files into fixed size
							blocks, create a mapping between blocks and files and also calculate hash values for all these
							blocks which would help in the de-duplication process. The difficult part is to implement
							this system over a network with one server handling concurrent requests for the same file
							from different client and we aim to solve this problem through this project. The project is
							somewhat analogous to the Amazon S3 repository which stores de-duplicated objects and
							provides access to users on an on-demand basis.

							ReasonableCare database system maintains medical reports, appointment information etc. for students and doctors who are part of the university. The system allows a student to book and cancel appointments with doctor as per availability or the type of health problem. At any time, a student or a doctor has access to his past and upcoming appointments and doctors and nurses can read and update a student medical records. Every new student has to get 3 vaccinations, which if not done by student by the end of first semester will lead to suspension of privileges on student’s records. The system also maintains student health insurance information and amount of co-payment required to be done by student which depends on whether the appointment is with a general practitioner or a specialist or it can depend on the reason of visit to the doctor. If the deductible amount for the current year has been paid in full by student, the health center tracks the health insurance information from student account and bill the insurance company for the remaining balance. Students takes consultations from nurses over the phone which is updated in system and is accessible to both the nurse and student for future reference. Nurses are able to access information of the list of doctors the student has been seeing for consulting or specific doctor in case of a particular requirement.

                            In last decade lot of efforts had been made by
                            research community to create sign language recognition system
                            which provide a medium of communication for differently-abled

                            Traffic classification has a vital role in tasks as wide ranging as trend analyses, adaptive networkbased
                            QoS marking of traffic, dynamic access control and lawful interception. Traditionally
                            performed using port and payload based analysis, recent years have seen an increased interest
                            in the development of machine learning techniques for classification.
                            
                            Much of this existing research focuses on the achievable accuracy (classification accuracy) of
                            different machine learning algorithms. These experiments have used different (thus not
                            comparable) datasets and features. The process of defining appropriate features, performing
                            feature selection and the influence of this on classification and computation performance has
                            not been studied.
                            
                            With this project we recognize that real-time traffic classifiers will operate under constraints,
                            which limit the number and type of features that can be calculated. On this basis we define 9
                            flow features like Flow Duration
Packet length
Inter-arrival time of packets
Number of packets
Throughput
Packet Size (minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation) which are simple to compute and are well understood within the networking
                            community. We evaluate the classification accuracy and computational performance of K-NN
                            Clustering Algorithm, Naïve Bayes Algorithm and Multi Class Logistic Regression algorithms using
                            the 9 features divided into the three reduced feature vectors.
