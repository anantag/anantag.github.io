                            Despite a recent push towards large-scale object recognition, activity recognition remains limited to narrow domains and small vocabularies of actions. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of recognizing and describing activities "in-the-wild". 
                            We present a solution that takes a short video clip and outputs a brief sentence that sums up the main activity in the video, such as the actor, the action and
                            its object. Unlike previous work, our approach works on
                            out-of-domain actions: it does not require training videos
                            of the exact activity. If it cannot find an accurate prediction
                            for a pre-trained model, it finds a less specific answer that
                            is also plausible from a pragmatic standpoint. We use semantic hierarchies learned from the data to help to choose
                            an appropriate level of generalization, and priors learned
                            from web-scale natural language corpora to penalize unlikely combinations of actors/actions/objects; we also use a
                            web-scale language model to "fill in" novel verbs, i.e. when
                            the verb does not appear in the training set. We evaluate
                            our method on a large YouTube corpus and demonstrate it
                            is able to generate short sentence descriptions of video clips
                            better than baseline approaches.

                            <i>Abstract:</i>
                            This work proposes a novel approach to construct threshold attribute based signatures inspired by ring signatures. Threshold
                            attribute based signatures, defined by a <i>(t, n)</i> threshold predicate, ensure that the signer holds atleast
                            <i>t</i> out of a specified set of <i>n</i> attributes to pass the verification. Another way to look at this would be
                            that, the signer has atleast 1 out of the <i>(n \choose t)</i> combination of attribute sets. Thus, a different approach to
                            t-ABS would be to let the signer pick some <i>n'</i> sets of <i>t</i> attributes each, from the <i>(n \choose t)</i> possible sets, and
                            prove that (s)he has atleast one of the <i>n'</i> sets in his/her possession. In this work, we provide a flexible
                            threshold-ABS scheme that realizes this approach and prove it secure with the help of random oracles.

                            Attribute Based Encryption is an encryption mechanism that is useful in settings where the
                            list of users may not be known apriori, but all users may possess certain credentials which can be used in
                            determining access control and at the same time providing a reasonable degree of anonymity. Ciphertext
                            policy attribute based encryption is a scheme that gives a natural way to link the access policy with the ciphertext,
                            and attributes with the keys; and cleverly combine them at a later stage to provide secure access to protected data.

                            <p>
                            In most ABE schemes the size of the ciphertext is quite large and is of the order of the number of
                            attributes. Recently, Herranz et al. proposed a constant size threshold ABE scheme for a single threshold policy. Extending Herranz's approach, we give a multi-level threshold attribute based encryption scheme
                            whose ciphertext size depends only on the size of the policy and is independent of the number of attributes.

The objective is to identify appropriate parameters and develop an algorithm to improve the classification accuracies of stars, galaxies and quasars.
