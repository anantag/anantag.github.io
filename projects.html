					Developed multi-classifier models to perform sentiment analysis of twitter data for the Sentiment140 dataset and compared the performance of Naive Bayes, MaxEntropy and SVM classifiers over different performance metrics.
					Achieved comparable results (~75% accuracy) to existing approaches despite using a general corpus and default parameters.

							Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis is the technique of determining the attitude of a speaker with
							respect to a topic or an overall document. Twitter is a popular platform where people express their
							opinions and sentiments. Sentiment analysis of twitter data can help in the search of products,
							companies, movies, books etc. based on the overall sentiment associated with that tweet.
							We present a sentiment analysis classification engine for Twitter data. We apply certain preprocessing
							approaches to cleanse the data, extract useful features from it and then build a training model on it. We
							present a comparative model using Naives Bayes, Max Entropy and SVM classifiers. We also collected
							results using the Random Forest and AdaBoost ensemble classifiers. We achieved an average accuracy
							of ~75% through different experiments using varied classifiers and preprocessing
							steps.

                    Developed a dialogue based system that provides the user with a spoken interface to search flights. Implemented the system as an android application that communicates with a remote Django server to perform language processing on user utterance through named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging etc.

VoiceTravel is an interactive flight search dialogue system designed for
mobile devices running the Android mobile operating system. The app accepts the search criteria
using voice based input from user and returns the flights matching the criteria. The search criteria in
the current version of the application includes origin-city, destination-city, date of travel and an optional
time parameter. The criteria can be specified in
regular English and in any order. Multiple criteria
can be specified in a single utterance as well.

VoiceTravel utilizes advancements in computational linguistics and smartphone space to disrupt
how air travel search is done.

					<br>
					
					Developed an in-line data de-duplication scheme for a file-system using fixed sized blocks for a network structure. System supports tag-based file retrieval, file-locking and caching at client end for bandwidth optimization. The system had a de-duplication factor of 0.7 over different test sets and also had a robust underlying peer to peer network

							The motivation of our project is to build a data de-duplication scheme which would enable
							us to build an object repository in a network. A network is characterized by several hosts,
							all requesting concurrent access to files and entering new files (objects) into the network.
							Hence, in order to meet the clients' needs, we need to come up with a computational solution
							which would enable a central server to service these requests and store data with minimum
							storage space.
							We came up with a client-server model where the server would break up files into fixed size
							blocks, create a mapping between blocks and files and also calculate hash values for all these
							blocks which would help in the de-duplication process. The difficult part is to implement
							this system over a network with one server handling concurrent requests for the same file
							from different client and we aim to solve this problem through this project. The project is
							somewhat analogous to the Amazon S3 repository which stores de-duplicated objects and
							provides access to users on an on-demand basis.
