							Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis is the technique of determining the attitude of a speaker with
							respect to a topic or an overall document. Twitter is a popular platform where people express their
							opinions and sentiments. Sentiment analysis of twitter data can help in the search of products,
							companies, movies, books etc. based on the overall sentiment associated with that tweet.
							We present a sentiment analysis classification engine for Twitter data. We apply certain preprocessing
							approaches to cleanse the data, extract useful features from it and then build a training model on it. We
							present a comparative model using Naives Bayes, Max Entropy and SVM classifiers. We also collected
							results using the Random Forest and AdaBoost ensemble classifiers. We achieved an average accuracy
							of ~75% through different experiments using varied classifiers and preprocessing
							steps.

VoiceTravel is an interactive flight search dialogue system designed for
mobile devices running the Android mobile operating system. The app accepts the search criteria
using voice based input from user and returns the flights matching the criteria. The search criteria in
the current version of the application includes origin-city, destination-city, date of travel and an optional
time parameter. The criteria can be specified in
regular English and in any order. Multiple criteria
can be specified in a single utterance as well.

VoiceTravel utilizes advancements in computational linguistics and smartphone space to disrupt
how air travel search is done.

							The motivation of our project is to build a data de-duplication scheme which would enable
							us to build an object repository in a network. A network is characterized by several hosts,
							all requesting concurrent access to files and entering new files (objects) into the network.
							Hence, in order to meet the clients' needs, we need to come up with a computational solution
							which would enable a central server to service these requests and store data with minimum
							storage space.
							We came up with a client-server model where the server would break up files into fixed size
							blocks, create a mapping between blocks and files and also calculate hash values for all these
							blocks which would help in the de-duplication process. The difficult part is to implement
							this system over a network with one server handling concurrent requests for the same file
							from different client and we aim to solve this problem through this project. The project is
							somewhat analogous to the Amazon S3 repository which stores de-duplicated objects and
							provides access to users on an on-demand basis.

In our work we implemented 3 popular address lookup algorithms, based on (i) binary trie (ii) multi-bit stride based Trie and (iii) linear length search based on Hash tables. </p>

                    <p><i>Abstract:</i> In this project we experiment with some of the existing data mining techniques like Support Vector Machines, kd-trees, decision trees and DBSCAN (density based spatial clustering with noise) to explore their feasibility in clustering and classifying astronomy objects (using spectral data). The objective is to identify appropriate parameters and develop an algorithm to improve the classification accuracies of stars, galaxies and quasars. We also compare how the choice of parameters and distance measures affect the performance of the algorithms.
